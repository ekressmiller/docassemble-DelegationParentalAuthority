id: Are you in the military?
question: | 
  Are you in the military?
subquestion: |
  Some service members use a Delegation of Parental Authority because they are:
  
  * deployed in a foreign country, or 
  * getting ready to deploy to a foreign country.
fields:
  - "Do you need this form for a military deployment?": military
    datatype: yesnoradio
    label above field: True

template: why_ask_military
subject: |
  How is military service related to this form?
content: |
  In most cases, a Delegation of Parental Authority (DPA) can only be in place for 6 months. However, if you are a service member deployed in a foreign country, a DPA can be in place during your entire deployment, plus 31 days after you return.
---
id: start end info
continue button field: start_end_info
question: |
  Starting and ending a DPA
subquestion: |
  % if military:
  ## When will the DPA be effective?
  
  Most of the time, a DPA can only be in place for 6 months. But service members deployed to a foreign country can have a DPA in place as long as they are deployed, and then for 31 days after they return. This is true even if the deployment is longer than 6 months. 
  % else: 
  ## When will the DPA be effective?
  
  You can choose when this DPA starts and ends. It can only be in place for 6 months, but you can sign another DPA when this one ends, if needed. 
  % endif

  A DPA only gives the caregiver power while a child’s parents are gone. When a parent is present to make a decision for your children, the caregiver does not have a right to interfere.

  ## Ending a DPA
  
  You can always end a DPA even if this form gives a later date. You can revoke (or cancel) a DPA by telling the named caregiver that you are ending it. It is a good idea to also end a DPA in writing.
